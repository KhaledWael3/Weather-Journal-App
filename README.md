# Weather-Journal App Project
This is my second project and I hope I implemented it well in this project.

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 
I used mostly ES6 in writing.
I used external packages : express,cors,latest node-version, body-parser.
The project simply gets the zip input from the user then fetches the temperature from the OpenWeatherMap website and posts it in my server and get the input feelings from the user and then posts it to my server then prints both of them on the website with the day of the request.

## How to use
You should just write the Zipcode of any city in the United States and your feelings(optional) then the website will show you the date, the temperature and your feelings.

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
